* feat: Show application status in Quick Tile title
   > - Introduced a new preference allowing users to display the application's status directly in the Quick Settings tile title. This is beneficial for OEM devices that do not show tile subtitles.
   > - Added a "Show Application Status in Quick Tile Title" switch in the settings UI.
   > - Updated `QuickTileService` to observe this preference and dynamically change the tile's label or subtitle.
   > - Refactored `SharedPrefsManager` to use the `edit { ... }` Kotlin extension for conciseness.
   > - Upgraded Kotlin version to `2.2.21`.
   > - Enabled `-Xcontext-parameters` compiler argument.
* fix PiP not working on WSA devices
   > for some reason, pressing the back button on WSA didn't trigger onUserLeaveHint or onPictureInPictureUiStateChanged, so I added a callback to onBackPressedDispatcher to handle the case
