Caffeinate is an App that helps android developers to keep their phone's display awake without having
to change the device settings. It can be toggled at various places:
   * A `tile` in the quick settings, the place that holds the toggles for e.g. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Requires
     Android 7 or higher.
   * A `button` in the app itself

Features:
   * Uses android's `WakeLock` Class with either `SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK` or `SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK` lock
     level based on user settings
   * Timeout period is configurable
   * Switch timeouts from the `quick settings tile` or the `button` in the app. clicking them, selects the
     next timeout and after `1 second` the timeout will start, if the `quick settings tile` or the `button`
     are clicked after starting, the timeout will stop.
   * Available timeouts are `[30 seconds, 05 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, âˆž]`
   * An option to enable the screen to dim while the `WakeLock` is acquired
   * An option to enable holding the `WakeLock` if the screen is locked, so that the screen will keep on
     after unlocking, default behaviour is that the `WakeLock` is released when the screen is locked
   * Multiple theming options `[light, dark, system default and material you]`
